This Python project fetches stock data from Alpha Vantage and performs a brute-force portfolio backtest with a rolling lookback to maximize the daily Sharpe ratio, applying weight constraints. The portfolio is rebalanced weekly, tracked over time, compared to SPY, and visualized with interactive plots.
